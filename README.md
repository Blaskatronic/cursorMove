# CursorMove v0.1 #

CursorMove uses Python to listen when a particular keyboard shortcut is pressed, as defined in cursorMove.py

When the shortcut is pressed, cursorMove moves the mouse to the top left of the screen.

## To Do: ##

* Package script for use on Windows and test
* Read shortcut in from config file so that it can be changed easily without recompiling
* Test with multiple monitors to see how it behaves
* Maybe read in the screen resolution from somewhere so that we can pick the middle of the screen rather than the top left?

## Patch Notes ##

v0.1: Mouse is correctly moved on correct shortcut
